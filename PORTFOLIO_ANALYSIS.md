# Portfolio Analysis: Negative Space (Regulatory Gap Mapping)

## 🎯 The Problem: Fragmented Global Financial Laws
Global trading strategies fail most often not because of math, but because of **Regulatory Blind Spots**. A firm might have a perfect Arbitrage Alpha, but if they lack a specific "License 4" in a secondary jurisdiction, the entire strategy is blocked. Identifying these "Gaps" is traditionally a slow, manual process for legal teams.

## 🛠️ The Solution: The Void Engine (AFRRC Tier 3)
Negative Space treats **Compliance Gaps** as first-class citizens. By using **Monte Carlo Interpolation (Layer 1)**, it estimates the risk of "Regulatory Voids" in unexplored markets. Its **Void Topology (Layer 5)** maps the complex web of cross-jurisdictional dependencies, identifying which single licenses or permits will "Collapse the Barriers" to the highest amount of liquidity.

## 📈 Outcome: Predictive Compliance Mapping
The result is a "Regulatory Radar" that predicts where a firm's strategy will hit friction before it happens. This allows the Quant Desk to proactively bridge gaps, reducing "Time-to-Liquidity" from months to days.
