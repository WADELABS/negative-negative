# Case File: Negative Space (Epistemological Substrate) 🌌

> **"My friend had a bike in three crates and a manual for the wrong year. He was trying to build a puzzle without knowing what the pieces looked like. I realized that if you know the shape of the engine and the shape of the frame, the 'missing' bracket already exists in the math between them. So I built Negative Space."**

## 🏛️ FORENSIC SUMMARY: Quantifying the Abyss
Negative Space is a high-fidelity **Epistemological Substrate** designed for the study and quantification of "Computational Doubt." It moves beyond simple knowledge retrieval and into the rigorous mapping of the **Unknown**. It is the search for the 'Missing Bracket' in complex data-streams.

### 🧠 Core Substrate Pillars
1. **Ontological Mapping**: Identifying the boundaries of a model's knowledge graph.
2. **Doubt Heuristics**: Calculating the "Epistemological Uncertainty" (EU) of any given dataset or response.
3. **Mechanical & Electrical Inference**: Predicting the 'Negative Space' where physical or logical components *must* exist based on surrounding constraints.

## ⚙️ Architecture
- **`src/ontology.py`**: Mapping semantic density and connectivity.
- **`src/doubt.py`**: Heuristics for calculating doubt scores based on data sparsity and contradiction frequency.
- **`docs/manifesto.md`**: The foundational treaty on Computational Epistemology.

## 🚀 Phase 3 Role
Negative Space is the "Scout" for the ecosystem. It identifies the "Dark Matter" in datasets—the information that isn't there but should be—enabling safe, novel generative solutions.
