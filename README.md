## 🏛️ Grounding: The Bio-Hazardous Compliance Gap
Transporting Class A pathogens or volatile biologicals requires navigating a "Void" of regulatory, technical, and logistical uncertainties. A single missing permit (CDC/WHO) or a gap in specialized storage can derail a global supply chain. Traditional gap analysis is manual, reactive, and often misses "Hidden Voids" that lead to catastrophic failure.

**Negative Space solves this by treating "What is Missing" as a primary data structure, interrogating the void through 7 layers of advanced logic.**

## 🚀 7-Layer Complexity Architecture

1.  **Probabilistic Void Interpolation**: (Layer 1) Uses **Monte Carlo** simulations to estimate the density of missing knowledge in a compliance chain, providing a "Risk Surface" map.
2.  **Multispectral Mapping**: (Layer 2) Layered analysis across Technical, Regulatory, Financial, and Ethical spectrums to ensure no "Invisible Voids" persist.
3.  **Dynamic Barrier Collapse**: (Layer 3) A "What-If" simulator that models the downstream impact of resolving a single gap, identifying the shortest path to total compliance.
4.  **Collective Epistemic Consensus**: (Layer 4) A multi-agent arbitration engine that resolves disagreements between specialized compliance sub-systems.
5.  **Graph-based Void Topology**: (Layer 5) Using **NetworkX** to map the inter-dependency of gaps and identify "Bottleneck Gaps" that block the entire project.
6.  **Temporal Void Drift**: (Layer 6) Real-time tracking of how "State Voids" evolve over time, detecting decaying compliance before it fails.
7.  **Auto-Mitigation Harnesses**: (Layer 7) Automated generation of technical mocks or regulatory "Next Step" protocols to bridge identified voids.

## 🛠️ Performance & Resilience
- **Predictive Closure**: Identifies the "First Domino" gaps that, when closed, resolve multiple downstream issues.
- **Topology-Aware**: Prioritizes bottlenecks over simple volume, optimizing resource allocation.
- **Epistemic Certainty**: Move from "We think we're safe" to "The void density is <0.05".
